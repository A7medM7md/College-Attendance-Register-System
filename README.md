# College Attendance Register System

This project is a desktop application built using Python and CustomTkinter to manage student attendance. The system offers both manual and automated methods for recording attendance, storing data in text files, and converting them into Excel format. Users can input student details and the subject name, which is saved in a text file. The system also allows for viewing attendance records and converting the data into an Excel sheet for further use.
