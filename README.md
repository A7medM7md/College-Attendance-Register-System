# College-Attendance-Register-System
This project is a desktop application built using Python and CustomTkinter to manage student attendance. The system offers both manual and automated methods for recording attendance, storing data in text files, and converting them into Excel format. Users can input student details and the subject name, which is saved in a text file. The system also allows for viewing attendance records and converting the data into an Excel sheet for further use.


Features:

Manual Attendance: Register student ID and name manually, assign them to a subject, and save to a text file.
Automatic Attendance: Placeholder for RFID-based automatic attendance (to be implemented).
Data Export: Convert stored attendance data into an Excel file for easy analysis.
View Attendance: Check recorded attendance through a simple text viewer.


Technologies Used:

Python
CustomTkinter (GUI)
Openpyxl (for Excel file handling)
CSV (for reading and writing text files)


How to Run:

Install the required libraries: openpyxl, csv, Pillow, and customtkinter.
Run the Python script.
Interact with the GUI to input student data and mark attendance.


Files:

DATA.txt: Stores the attendance records.
data.xlsx: Converted Excel file (generated from DATA.txt).


Future Features:

RFID-based automatic attendance registration.
